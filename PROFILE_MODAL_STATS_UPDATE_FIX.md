# ProfileModal Stats Update - Manual Test Results

## Issue
The profile modal stats number for "Cards Completed" was not updating when cards were moved to the done column. The stats would only refresh when the modal was closed and reopened.

## Solution Implemented
1. **Added React state management**: Created `userStats` and `achievementData` state variables in ProfileModal
2. **Added useEffect polling**: Set up a polling mechanism that checks for achievement updates every 1000ms when modal is open
3. **Replaced direct calls**: Changed from calling `achievementManager.getUserStats()` directly to using the state variables
4. **Added cleanup**: Properly cleans up the polling interval when modal closes

## Code Changes Made
- `ProfileModal.tsx`: Added useState and useEffect to track achievement data changes
- `App.tsx`: Exposed achievementManager to window object for testing

## Automated Test Results
✅ **Achievement tracking works correctly:**
- Cards completed stats update immediately when tracked
- Achievement progress shows correct percentages
- Data persists correctly to localStorage
- Duplicate prevention works properly

## Manual Testing Instructions
1. Open the Kanban application in browser
2. Open the Profile Modal (click profile icon or user avatar)
3. Note the current "Cards Completed" number
4. **Without closing the modal**, drag and drop a card from any column to the "Done" column
5. **Within 1 second**, the "Cards Completed" number should increment
6. Drag another card to Done - the number should increment again
7. Try dragging the same card out of Done and back - it should not double-count

## Expected Behavior
- ✅ Stats update in real-time (within 1 second) without closing modal
- ✅ Numbers persist when modal is closed and reopened
- ✅ No duplicate counting of the same card
- ✅ Proper tracking when cards are moved in and out of done column

## Performance Considerations
- Polling runs only when modal is open (stops when closed)
- 1-second interval provides good balance between responsiveness and performance
- Polling automatically cleans up to prevent memory leaks

## Status: COMPLETED ✅
The ProfileModal now correctly updates achievement stats in real-time when cards are moved to the done column.
